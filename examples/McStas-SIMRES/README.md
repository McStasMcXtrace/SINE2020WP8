#1 SIMRES-MCStas integration scheme.

To enable SIMRES continuation of _any_ McStas-simulation it is sufficent to
enrich the McStas-simulation with a `MCPL_output.comp` positioned at the
switching point.
With the present releases of McStas and SIMRES the integration is one-way, but
the upcoming release of SIMRES _will_ include similar support for going the
other way around. (The software is written but awaits release)
