The descriptions in this directory refer to the BIFROST instrument at ESS, see https://europeanspallationsource.se/instruments/bifrost

1_CombLayer:
	Folder with short instruction how to generate the MCNP decks using CombLayer
	
2_MCNP:
	Folder with decks for use with MCNP to transport from protons on ESS target to DXTRAN spheres at beam extraction point and sample position. The difference between the two decks is the application of a supermirror guide patch to MCNP.

3_MCPL:
	Folder with short instruction how to generate MCPL formatted files from the above MCNP SSW outputs 

4_McStas:
	McStas instrument for use with the MCPL output generated in step 3


Work in progress, we should document all steps needed to generate MCPL file and use with McStas, interpret the data etc.
